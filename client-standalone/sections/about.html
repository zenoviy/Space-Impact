                <h4>Beta Game Build</h4>
                <p>A simple 2d platformer game based on technology such as: Webpack, Electron, NodeJS/Express/Handlebars, html/Javascript/Typescript, sass/css. 
                    In this App i was using lots of different approaches, working with Canvas 2d, File system, create/overwrite/delete files, create pictures, base 64 encoding,
                    module architecture based on webpack builder. The first goal was just
                    to create a simple arcade fly game, but then i decided to create a ground levels. To achieve this i needed to create a game level editor
                    where i can create, edit, rebuild levels.
                </p>
                <p>This game was inspired by old retro game of 80-90, like "Contra", "Jets'n'Guns Gold" and others. The main plot is: In the nearest future, humanity began to explore.
                    There is a many aero-space company start to build colony and outposts outside the Earth. You play as a Major
                    of the National Air Force. You and your team were alerted bout unknown enemy invasion to the Limebrook City, you have a special mission to find and protect General somewhere 
                    in the city, that's how the story begin. Everything else depends on the player.
